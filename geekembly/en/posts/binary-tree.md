Here's a demonstration of a binray tree. Starting from the bottom center, we make our first branch straigh up (with 90 degree) and at each new level, we create two more branches, each one with a small angle to the left and write (90 degree +/- theta). Keep doing the same for the next branches, you'll get the binray :deciduous_tree:
