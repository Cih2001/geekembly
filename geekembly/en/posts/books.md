This month, I finished reading two enlightening books: "The Bitcoin Standard" and "Economics in One Lesson".
These two really broadened my understanding of economics and politics. If you're interested in
Austrian school economics, anarcho-capitalism, or liberalism, don't miss your chance with these two.

What's the next step? Well, on friend's recommendation, reading the exactly opposite view: [Undoing the Demos: Neoliberalism`s Stealth Revolution](https://amzn.eu/d/0y6YVG0).
