## Introduction

Having a functioning weblog is one thing; gaining insights from it is another. Leveraging [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for metrics collection and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for visualization, we can create an insightful dashboard for our weblog.

## Installation

We'll install the Prometheus stack using its community Helm charts via an Argo CD application. First, add the following application configuration to your `apps.yaml` file:

```yaml
- apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Application
  metadata:
    name: kube-prometheus-stack
    namespace: argocd
  spec:
    project: default
    source:
      repoURL: https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
      chart: kube-prometheus-stack
      targetRevision: 60.3.0
      helm:
        releaseName: kube-prometheus-stack
        values: |
          namespaceOverride: monitoring
          grafana:
            ingress:
              enabled: true
              ingressClassName: nginx
              annotations:
                cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
                acme.cert-manager.io/http01-edit-in-place: "true"
                nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"
              hosts:
                - grafana.<your-domain>.com
              tls:
                - hosts:
                    - grafana.<your-domain>.com
                  secretName: grafana.<your-domain>.com-tls
              path: /
    destination:
      namespace: monitoring
      server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    syncPolicy:
      syncOptions:
        - CreateNamespace=true
        - ServerSideApply=true
```

This configuration will install the Prometheus stack in the `monitoring` namespace. It also sets up the Grafana ingress, allowing us to access Grafana later on. For Prometheus, no ingress configuration is needed; its web UI can be accessed via port-forwarding.

Apply this configuration with:

```sh
kubectl apply -f apps.yaml
```

Next, change the Grafana admin password:

```sh
argocd app set kube-prometheus-stack -p 'garafana.adminPassword=<grafana-admin-password-here>'
```

## Test Prometheus

To verify Prometheus, port-forward from your machine to the Prometheus service:

```sh
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus 9090:9090
```

Visit `https://localhost:9090` in your browser. Navigate to `Status > Targets` to view the configured targets, which should be already set up.

If the `kube-proxy` target does not appear healthy, modify its configuration to bind metrics on all interfaces:

```sh
kubectl edit cm -n kube-system kube-proxy
```

Change `metricsBindAddress: 127.0.0.1:10249` to `metricsBindAddress: 0.0.0.0:10249`.

## Test Grafana

Open your browser and navigate to `https://grafana.<your-domain>.com`. Log in using your admin credentials. You should see Alertmanager and Prometheus already listed as data sources.

Additionally, some default dashboards should be pre-configured.

## Geekembly Metrics

### Prometheus Nginx Exporter

To gain insights from our weblog, Geekembly, we'll configure an Nginx Prometheus exporter to expose Nginx metrics.

Add the Nginx exporter as a sidecar to your current deployment by modifying your `deployment.yaml` as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: geekembly-dpl
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: geekembly
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: geekembly
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: geekembly
          image: geekembly:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
              name: http
          volumeMounts:
            - name: nginx-config
              mountPath: /etc/nginx/conf.d/nginx_status.conf
              subPath: nginx_status.conf
        - name: nginx-exporter
          image: nginx/nginx-prometheus-exporter:latest
          args:
            - -nginx.scrape-uri=http://localhost:8080/stub_status
          ports:
            - containerPort: 9113
              name: metrics
      volumes:
        - name: nginx-config
          configMap:
            name: nginx-config
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: regcred
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: geekembly
  name: nginx-config
data:
  nginx_status.conf: |
    server {
        listen 8080;

        location /stub_status {
            stub_status;
            allow all;
        }
    }
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: geekembly-svc
  labels:
    app: geekembly
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 80
      name: http
      protocol: TCP
    - port: 9113
      name: metrics
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: geekembly
```

The Nginx exporter exposes metrics on port `9113` for Prometheus to scrape, while Nginx exports `stub_status` on port `8080`.

Next, configure Prometheus to scrape this new endpoint using a custom resource definition (CRD) called `ServiceMonitor`. Create a `servicemonitor.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    release: kube-prometheus-stack
  name: geekembly-sm
  namespace: geekembly
spec:
  endpoints:
    - port: metrics
      interval: 30s
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: geekembly
```

Apply all these configurations, then navigate to the Prometheus targets page to verify the new target for your weblog is active.

### Grafana Dashboard

Now that Prometheus collects Nginx metrics, we can create a Grafana dashboard to visualize them.

1. Navigate to `Grafana > Dashboards > New Dashboard > Add Visualization`.
2. Select Prometheus as the data source.
3. Add `nginx_http_requests_total` as a metric and set the title to `Total Requests`.
4. Save the dashboard.

Similarly, you can add visualizations for total HTTP requests rate, active connections, and connections handled.

## Conclusion

We've successfully set up a comprehensive monitoring solution using Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization. This setup allows us to gather and analyze data from our weblog and the cluster in which it runs. In the next episode, we'll integrate Grafana Loki and Alloys for log collection and visualization. Stay tuned! ðŸš€
