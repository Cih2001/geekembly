## Intro

In [Episode 1](/homelab/ep01), we discussed the challenges posed by Vodafone's lack of IPv4 port-forwarding and GitHub's lack of IPv6 support. To work around these limitations, I've rented a VPS from Digital Ocean. This VPS will forward IPv4 traffic to our device that's exposed over IPv6. Then, within our server, we'll convert this IPv6 traffic back to IPv4 before passing it on to our Kubernetes cluster.

If you can port-forward IPv4 traffic, you can skip this part and forward the external traffic to your pfSense modem instead. The diagram below illustrates our overall network architecture.

In part 1 of this episode, we did set up pfSense. For this part, we'll set up the Edge virtual PC, expose it through our Vodafone modem, and configure our Digital Ocean VPS for traffic tunneling using Nginx. Note that this setup will limit us to HTTP and HTTPS traffic but should suffice for most web applications.

### Edge Virtual PC

First, let's create a virtual machine called _Edge Services_. This VM will have two network interfaces: one connected to the Vodafone Modem (with an IPv6 address) and another connected to pfSense. This configuration enables traffic forwarding from the Vodafone modem to pfSense.

1. Follow the instructions in [Episode 2](http://localhost:8080/homelab/ep02/#installing-a-debian-cloud-image) to install a Debian cloud image on this VM.
2. Configure the VM with the following settings:

| Device | Description                |
| ------ | -------------------------- |
| cpu    | socket = 1, core = 1(host) |
| ram    | 256 Mi                     |
| disk   | 2 Gi                       |
| net 0  | bride to vmbr0             |
| net 1  | bride to vmbr0, tag = 100  |

#### Install and configure Qemu Guest Agent (optional)

To enable Proxmox to detect the IP addresses assigned to each network interface, install the Qemu guest agent. SSH into your Edge VM as root and execute the following commands:

```sh
apt install qemu-guest-agent
systemctl enable qemu-guest-agent
systemctl start qemu-guest-agent
```

This should display the IP address on the Edge VM status page in Proxmox.

While both network interfaces should automatically receive IP addresses via DHCP, setting static IPs is advisable for consistent Nginx configuration. Use the cloud-init method described in Episode 2. In our example, the IPs are `192.168.0.201` for the external interface and `10.100.0.2` for the internal interface.

Run `ifconfig` to verify your configuration:

```
eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.0.201  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.0.255
        inet6 2aXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX::d298  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x0<global>

        inet 10.100.0.2  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 10.100.0.255
        inet6 fe80::be24:11ff:fea5:db0a  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>

        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 1749093  bytes 819816787 (781.8 MiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

lo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536
        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10<host>
        loop  txqueuelen 1000  (Local Loopback)
        RX packets 86  bytes 6908 (6.7 KiB)

        TX packets 86  bytes 6908 (6.7 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

The IPv6 address on eth0 is the one we are going to expose to outside later.

#### Install and configure Nginx

1. Install Nginx using the following commands:

```sh
apt install nginx
apt install libnginx-mod-stream # if not installed by above
```

2. Configure Nginx to forward incoming traffic from `geekembly.com` to your Kubernetes cluster. Edit `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` to include:

```nginx
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        server_name geekembly.com www.geekembly.com docker.registry.geekembly.com argo.geekembly.com argocd.geekembly.com github.geekembly.com ;

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://10.100.0.128;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
}
```

Replace `geekembly.com` and the subdomains with your own. The IP address `10.100.0.128` corresponds to the range reserved for `metallb` in your Kubernetes setup.

Above, forwards the traffic from the subdomains I expect traffic on and we will setup DNS records for each to `https://10.100.0.128`. Remember to replace geekembly with your own domain, and adjust the names of the subdomain to what you have. If you don't one any of them, just remove them.

If your are wondering what is IP address `10.100.0.128` for, well, if you remember from the previous part, the DHCP pool we made available on KubernetesVLAN100 was from `10.100.0.10` to `10.100.0.127`, and I mentioned that the higher address from 128 are reserved for metallb. `10.100.0.128` is the first address in that range, used by metallb to expose our k8s nginx ingress. More on this later, for us, at the moment, it just the gate to our k8s cluster.

3. Forward HTTPS traffic by editing `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:

```nginx
# At the beginning of config file
load_module /usr/lib/nginx/modules/ngx_stream_module.so;

# At the end of config file
stream {
        server {
                listen 443;
                listen [::]:443;
                proxy_pass 10.100.0.128:443;
        }
}
```

Since we are going to use cert-manager in our kuberenets cluster, and our https connections will terminate there, all we need to do is to just stream https traffic to the kubernetes cluster.

### Exposing Edge VM

Expose the Edge VM using the IPv6 Host Exposure feature of your Vodafone modem. Log in to your modem's admin panel and navigate to the IPv6 Host Exposure settings. Expose ports 80 and 443 of your Edge VM.

![IPv6 Expose](/homelab/img/ep03/15.png)

Test connectivity with the following command:

```sh
curl http://\[<exposed-ipv6-address-here>\]
```

You should see an Nginx error page.

### Configuring our VPS

As mentioned previously, we need to configure a VPS to use it as our host for `geekembly.com` traffic. For that, I've utilized a Digital Ocean Droplet. You can use any cloud provider you prefer. Setting up that VPS is almost idential to configuring our Edge service, just in reverse: We need to tunnel IPv4 traffic to IPv6.

On `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` we have:

```nginx
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        server_name geekembly.com www.geekembly.com docker.registry.geekembly.com argo.geekembly.com argocd.geekembly.com github.geekembly.com ;

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://[<ipv6-address-of-edge-service>];
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
}
```

and on `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` we have:

```nginx
# At the beginning of config file
load_module /usr/lib/nginx/modules/ngx_stream_module.so;

# At the end of config file
stream {
        server {
                listen 443;
                listen [::]:443;
                proxy_pass [<ipv6-address-of-edge-service>]:443;
        }
}
```

The only diff is that we proxy pass to exposed ipv6 address of the Edge VM.

**NOTE**: When using IPv6 addresses, you have to put them inside square brackets like `[]`.

### Configure DNS records

Finally, configure the DNS records for your domain. Access your domain registrar's control panel and set up the following records:

| type  | domain | IP                   |
| ----- | ------ | -------------------- |
| CNAME | www    | Clone of your domain |
| A     | github | VPS IP address       |
| A     | argo   | VPS IP address       |

Include an A record for each subdomain you plan to use. Above are just some examples.

With this setup in place, our network configuration is ready. In the next episode, weâ€™ll provision our Kubernetes cluster using Terraform! ðŸš€
