**NOTE**: Many commands in this post make use of specific constants tied to my own setup. Make sure to tailor these to your own needs. These examples should serve as a guide, not as direct instructions to copy and paste.

**NOTE**: Check out the final code at [homelab](https://github.com/Cih2001/homelab) repo on my Github account.

## Introduction

In the previous [episode](/homelab/ep10/), we set up our first application, Sealed Secrets. In this episode, we will set up our second application, [Minio](https://min.io/). Minio is an object storage solution similar to Amazon's S3. Having our own object storage is essential for several reasons:

1. **Self-Sufficiency:** Modern applications often require object storage, and since we are setting up a bare-metal cluster, we cannot utilize cloud providers’ storage solutions. Hence, we need to create our own.
2. **Pipeline Storage:** We'll use this object storage to store pipeline artifacts when we set up Argo Workflows.
3. **Container Registry:** This storage will help us create our own container registry, ensuring that we do not need to push our container images to Docker Hub or other external services.
4. **Log Persistence:** We will use this storage to persist logs captured by Grafana Loki later.

## Installtion

### Minio Deployment

Minio is easy to deploy, so we don't need to use a Helm chart. Instead, we'll create our deployment files and create an Argo application to deploy them.

First, we'll create a sealed secret to hold the admin username and password:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic minio-admin-sec -o yaml -n minio --dry-run=client --from-literal='username=<your-user>' --from-literal='password=<your-password>' | kubeseal -o yaml
```

Save this output to a YAML file, for example, `secrets.yaml`.

Next, we'll need a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) to store objects:

```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  namespace: minio
  name: minio-claim
spec:
  storageClassName: nfs-client
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 200Gi
```

Then, we create a pod to run Minio:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    app: minio
  name: minio
  namespace: minio
spec:
  containers:
    - name: minio
      image: quay.io/minio/minio:latest
      command:
        - /bin/bash
        - -c
      args:
        - minio server /data --console-address :9090
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /data
          name: minio-vol
      env:
        - name: MINIO_ROOT_USER
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: minio-admin-sec
              key: username
        - name: MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: minio-admin-sec
              key: password
  volumes:
    - name: minio-vol
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: minio-claim
```

Next, we set up a service for Minio:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  namespace: minio
  name: minio-svc
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 9090
      protocol: TCP
      name: ui-port
    - port: 9000
      targetPort: 9000
      protocol: TCP
      name: api-port
  selector:
    app: minio
```

And finally, we configure an ingress to access Minio:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  namespace: minio
  name: minio-ingress
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
    acme.cert-manager.io/http01-edit-in-place: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: "500m"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - minio.<your-domain-name>.com
        - minio.api.<your-domain-name>.com
      secretName: minio-tls-ingress
  rules:
    - host: minio.<your-domain-name>.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: minio-svc
                port:
                  name: ui-port
    - host: minio.api.<your-domain-name>.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: minio-svc
                port:
                  name: api-port
```

### Argo Application

In [episode 10](/homelab/ep10/#installation), we created `apps.yaml`. Now it's time to add the Minio app to it. Append the following configuration to `apps.yaml`:

```yaml
- apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Application
  metadata:
    name: minio
    namespace: argocd
  spec:
    destination:
      namespace: minio
      server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    project: default
    source:
      path: applications/minio # path to minio deployment in the repo
      repoURL: https://github.com/<your-github-repo>.git
    syncPolicy:
      automated:
        prune: true
      syncOptions:
        - CreateNamespace=true
```

This configuration creates an ArgoCD application for our deployment files, assuming they are in the `applications/minio` directory. Remember to replace `<your-github-repo>` with the correct repository URL.

Apply this configuration by running:

```sh
kubectl apply -f app.yaml
```

But, ArgoCD needs access to your GitHub repository. For this, generate a GitHub token by navigating to [GitHub Personal Access Tokens (Classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generating a new token with full repo access permissions.

![Token](/homelab/img/ep11/token.png).

Add your repository to ArgoCD:

```sh
argocd repo add https://github.com/<your-github-repo>.git --username=<your-github-username> --password=<your-token>
```

Ensure your Kubernetes context is set to the ArgoCD namespace, before running the above command.

```sh
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=argocd
```

If you run into issues, consult the ArgoCD [docs](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/private-repositories/).

By syncing the Minio app in ArgoCD, the Minio deployment will automatically be created. ArgoCD polls GitHub every 5 minutes. If you don't want to wait, sync manually or set up a GitHub webhook for real-time updates. For webhook setup, navigate to your GitHub project settings and set the payload URL to `https://argocd.<your-domain>.com/api/webhook`, with content type `application/json` and the only `push events` selected. If you want to use a webhook secret, follow the steps outlined in [episode 9](/homelab/ep09/#github-webhook-secret).

### Minio Config

With the steps above completed, you should have a working Minio instance. Visit `minio.<your-domain>.com` in your browser to access the Minio login page, and log in with the credentials you set.

![Minio](/homelab/img/ep11/minio.png).

To access Minio using the CLI, install the Minio Client by following the [documentation](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html).

Then, create an alias for the CLI:

```sh
mc alias set admin https://minio.api.<your-domain-name>.com <your-user> <your-password>
```

Replace the placeholders with the admin username and password you previously set.

Now, you can create a bucket in Minio:

```sh
mc mb admin/test-bucket
```

To list the contents of the newly created bucket (which should be empty for now):

```sh
mc ls admin/test-bucket
```

## Testing Minio

That's it for now! You can experiment with your object storage—try copying a file into the bucket using `mc` and perform some tests. In the next episode, we'll use Minio to create a container registry. :whale: :rocket:
