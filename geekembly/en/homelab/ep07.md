**NOTE**: Many commands in this post make use of specific constants tied to my own setup. Make sure to tailor these to your own needs. These examples should serve as a guide, not as direct instructions to copy and paste.

**NOTE**: Check out the final code at [homelab](https://github.com/Cih2001/homelab) repo on my Github account.

## Introduction

In our [fifth episode](/homelab/ep05#conclusion), we discussed the limitations of bare metal Kubernetes clusters compared to those managed by cloud providers. Specifically, we noted that we can't expose services by setting their type to `LoadBalancer`. This requires us to repeatedly perform port-forwarding to access servicesâ€”a significant limitation. To overcome this, we need [MetalLB](https://metallb.io/), a load balancer designed for bare metal Kubernetes clusters. I strongly recommend you manually install MetalLB on your Kubernetes cluster by following their [installation guide](https://metallb.io/installation/). Doing it manually provides a deeper understanding of what goes into the process. Here, we'll choose a different route and configure Kubespray to install it for us.

## Installation

### Metallb

Remember from [episode 5](/homelab/ep05#installation) that we stated we would revisit our cluster configuration by modifying `cluster_variables.yaml`? It's time to modify this file to include MetalLB in our Kubernetes installation process. Add the following lines to `cluster_variables.yaml`:

```yaml
metallb_enabled: true
metallb_speaker_enabled: "{{ metallb_enabled }}"
metallb_namespace: "metallb-system"
metallb_version: v0.13.9
metallb_protocol: "layer2"
metallb_port: "7472"
metallb_memberlist_port: "7946"
metallb_config:
  speaker:
    nodeselector:
      kubernetes.io/os: "linux"
    tolerations:
      - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: ""
        effect: "NoSchedule"
  controller:
    nodeselector:
      kubernetes.io/os: "linux"
    tolerations:
      - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: ""
        effect: "NoSchedule"
  address_pools:
    primary:
      ip_range:
        - 10.100.0.128/25
      auto_assign: true
  layer2:
    - primary
```

This configuration enables MetalLB and sets it up using the Layer 2 protocol. Weâ€™re dedicating the higher range of our VLAN `10.100.0.128/25` for MetalLB and specifying that MetalLB components (speaker and controller) should run on Linux nodes while tolerating control-plane nodes with `NoSchedule` taints. Adjust this configuration based on your own subnet if necessary.

**NOTE:** As mentioned in episode [episode 3 part 1](/homelab/ep03p01#configuring-dhcp), we reserved the higher range IPs of our VLAN `10.100.0.128/25` for the metallb.

After adding these configurations, recreate your cluster. As per [episode 5](/homelab/ep05), you can do this by running:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini -e @cluster_variables.yaml --user=ansible playbook.yml
```

**NOTE**: The above command may be destructive. If the NFS subdir provisioner stops working after running it, follow the steps in [episode 6](/homelab/ep06/#nfs-subdir-provisioner) to reinstall it.

If everything goes well, MetalLB should be ready to use. Let's test it.

## Test MetalLB

To test MetalLB, deploy an Nginx instance using the following YAML definition:

```sh
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: test-nginx
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  namespace: test-nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
  namespace: test-nginx
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
EOF
```

Now, run

```sh
kubectl get svc -n test-nginx
```

MetalLB should allocate an external IP for your service from the VLAN subnet's higher range.

```
NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)        AGE
nginx-service   LoadBalancer   10.233.33.183   10.100.0.129   80:30317/TCP   38h
```

Navigate to that IP in your browser to ensure you can access Nginx. Finally, clean up the test deployment:

```sh
kubectl delete namespace test-nginx
```

With MetalLB set up, we now have a load balancer. Next, we can set up our ingress in a similar manner. ðŸš€
