**NOTE**: Many commands in this post make use of specific constants tied to my own setup. Make sure to tailor these to your own needs. These examples should serve as a guide, not as direct instructions to copy and paste.

**NOTE**: Check out the final code at [homelab](https://github.com/Cih2001/homelab) repo on my Github account.

## Introduction

In the previous [episode](/homelab/ep12), we created our own private container repository. Now, our next step is to install [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/), a container-native workflow engine designed for orchestrating jobs on Kubernetes. We'll utilize this for our CI pipeline.

## Installation

### ArgoCD Application

Similar to other applications, we can install Argo Workflows as an ArgoCD application. However, this time we will use community-managed Helm charts. Add the following configuration to your `apps.yaml` file:

```yaml
- apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Application
  metadata:
    name: argo-workflows
    namespace: argocd
  spec:
    destination:
      namespace: argo
      server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    project: default
    source:
      chart: argo-workflows
      repoURL: https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
      targetRevision: 0.41.8
      helm:
        releaseName: argo-workflows
        values: |
          server:
            ingress:
              enabled: true
              hosts:
                - argo.<your-domain>.com
              ingressClassName: nginx
              annotations:
                cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
                acme.cert-manager.io/http01-edit-in-place: "true"
                nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"
              tls:
                - hosts:
                    - argo.<your-domain>.com
                  secretName: argo.<your-domain>.com-tls
    syncPolicy:
      automated:
        prune: true
      syncOptions:
        - CreateNamespace=true
```

Apply these configurations with:

```sh
kubectl apply -f app.yaml
```

This command installs Argo Workflows for you and sets up the necessary ingress configuration. Ensure you create an `A` record in your domain's DNS for `argo.<your-domain>.com`.

### Accessing UI

Navigate to `argo.<your-domain>.com` in your browser. You should see the login page:

![login](/homelab/img/ep13/login.png)

To log in, you need a Bearer token. Create one by applying the following secret configuration:

```sh
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  namespace: argo
  name: argo.service-account-token
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: argo-workflows-server
type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
EOF
```

Retrieve the token with:

```sh
ARGO_TOKEN="Bearer $(kubectl get secret argo.service-account-token -n argo -o=jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode)"
echo $ARGO_TOKEN
```

Using this token, you should be able to log in to the Argo Workflows UI.

### Argo Workflows Configuration

Argo Workflows comes with a CLI, which is the preferred method for interaction. Install it by following the [official documentation](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/walk-through/argo-cli/).

### Use Minio As Artifact Repository

Workflow steps in Argo can produce output [artifacts](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/walk-through/artifacts/). We can store these artifacts in our Minio object storage.

First, log into Minio and create an access token by navigating to the access keys section:

![Access](/homelab/img/ep12/access.png)

Add the access key to the `mc` CLI using:

```sh
mc alias set workflow-ak http://minio.api.<your-domain>.com <access-key> <secret>
```

Create a bucket named `artifacts-repo` using the Minio UI:

```sh
mc mb workflow-ak/artifacts-repo
```

Define this repository configuration in Argo Workflows:

```sh
k apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: argo
  name: artifacts-repository
  annotations:
    workflows.argoproj.io/default-artifact-repository: default-v1-s3-artifact-repository
data:
  default-v1-s3-artifact-repository: |
    s3:
      bucket: artifacts-repo
      endpoint: minio-svc.minio:9000
      insecure: true
      accessKeySecret:
        name: minio-workflow-ak-sec
        key: accessKey
      secretKeySecret:
        name: minio-workflow-ak-sec
        key: secretKey
      region: us-east-1
EOF
```

Refer to [Storing Artifacts](#storing-artifacts) for subsequent use of this artifact repository in workflows.

**NOTE** the annotation in the above config is how we introduce this artifact repository to Argo Workflows.

## Test Argo Workflows

To test Argo Workflows, start by creating a test namespace and set your current context to it:

```sh
kubectl create namespace test-workflows
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=test-workflows
```

Then follow the next sub section to setup a service account

### Configuring Workflow Service Account

By default, workflows in a namespace use the default service account, which generally lacks sufficient privileges. Define a role with the necessary permissions:

```sh
kubectl create role argo-workflows-admin \
  --namespace test-workflows \
  --verb=list --verb=get --verb=watch --verb=patch --verb=create --verb=update --verb=delete \
  --resource=workflowtaskresults.argoproj.io
```

Bind this role to the default service account:

```sh
kubectl create rolebinding default-argo-workflows-admin-rb --role=argo-workflows-admin --serviceaccount=test-workflows:default -n test-workflows
```

### Running a "Hello World" Workflow

Deploy your first simple workflow:

```sh
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow                  # new type of k8s spec
metadata:
  namespace: test-workflows
  name: first-workflow
spec:
  entrypoint: whalesay          # invoke the whalesay template
  templates:
    - name: whalesay              # name of the template
      container:
        image: docker/whalesay
        command: [ cowsay ]
        args: [ "hello world" ]
        resources: # limit the resources
          limits:
            memory: 32Mi
            cpu: 100m
EOF
```

Check the workflow logs:

```sh
argo logs -n test-workflows @latest --follow
# Output will look like:
# first-workflow:  _____________
# first-workflow: < hello world >
# first-workflow:  -------------
# first-workflow:     \
# first-workflow:      \
# first-workflow:       \
# first-workflow:                     ##        .
# first-workflow:               ## ## ##       ==
# first-workflow:            ## ## ## ##      ===
# first-workflow:        /""""""""""""""""___/ ===
# first-workflow:   ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~
# first-workflow:        \______ o          __/
# first-workflow:         \    \        __/
# first-workflow:           \____\______/
# first-workflow: time="2024-07-04T21:58:04.984Z" level=info msg="sub-process exited" argo=true error="<nil>"
```

Also from UI:

![first workflow](/homelab/img/ep13/first.png)

### Storing Artifacts

To use the artifact repository in every workflow namespace:

1. Create the `minio-workflow-ak-sec` Secret:

   ```sh
   k create secret generic -n test-workflows minio-workflow-ak-sec --dry-run=client --from-literal="accessKey=<minio-access-key>" --from-literal="secretKey=<minio-secret-key>" --output=yaml | kubeseal -o yaml | k apply -f -
   ```

1. Create a workflow using this configuration (save it as `test.yaml`):

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  namespace: test-workflows
  generateName: test-artifacts-
spec:
  artifactRepositoryRef:
    configMap: artifacts-repository
  entrypoint: artifact-example
  templates:
    - name: artifact-example
      steps:
        - - name: generate-artifact
            template: whalesay
        - - name: consume-artifact
            template: print-message
            arguments:
              artifacts:
                # bind message to the hello-art artifact
                # generated by the generate-artifact step
                - name: message
                  from: "{{steps.generate-artifact.outputs.artifacts.hello-art}}"

    - name: whalesay
      container:
        image: docker/whalesay:latest
        command: [sh, -c]
        args: ["cowsay hello world | tee /tmp/hello_world.txt"]
      outputs:
        artifacts:
          # generate hello-art artifact from /tmp/hello_world.txt
          # artifacts can be directories as well as files
          - name: hello-art
            path: /tmp/hello_world.txt

    - name: print-message
      inputs:
        artifacts:
          # unpack the message input artifact
          # and put it at /tmp/message
          - name: message
            path: /tmp/message
      container:
        image: alpine:latest
        command: [sh, -c]
        args: ["cat /tmp/message"]
```

**NOTE**: To reference the artifact repository in your workflows this part is essential

```yaml
spec:
  artifactRepositoryRef:
    configMap: artifact-repositories
```

Submit the workflow with:

```sh
argo submit -n test-workflows test.yaml
```

You can verify the workflow execution from the UI:

![artifact workflow](/homelab/img/ep13/artifact.png)

## Conclusion

We have successfully installed and set up Argo Workflows. However, you should explore it further by creating various types of workflows, templates, and cron workflows. I highly recommend following the [official walkthrough](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/walk-through/) to deepen your understanding. Take at least two days of practice here.

In the next episode, we will explore building a static blog with GoHugo! Stay tuned! :rocket:
